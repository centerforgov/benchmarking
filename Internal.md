# Internal Benchmarking

Internal Benchmarking is simply comparing yourself . . . to yourself. If an organization wants to know what success looks like, they should first look to the data on what they have been capable of in the past. The most iconic example of internal benchmarking is COMPSTAT.

COMPSTAT is the New York City Police Department's (NYPD) accountability process. It is both a management philosophy and a tool for police department managers to identify spikes in crime using comparative statistics (or internal benchmarking).
